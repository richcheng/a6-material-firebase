# DEVELOPER

## Quick start

First clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/jeroenouw/AngularMaterialFirebase.git`.  
Change directory to this project  
Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.  
Run `npm start` to run this project. This will run with the AoT Compiler.  
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  

## Development

For own projects please use different keys in `src/app/app.component.ts`:  

```typescript

firebase.initializeApp({
  // For other projects use different keys
  apiKey: '[YOUR_KEY]',
  authDomain: '[YOUR_KEY]',
  databaseURL: '[YOUR_KEY]',
  projectId: '[YOUR_KEY]',
  storageBucket: '[YOUR_KEY]',
  messagingSenderId: '[YOUR_KEY]'
});

```

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  

To build the development environment, run `npm run dist`.

## Production

To build the production environment, run `npm run prod`. This will run with the AoT Compiler.  
To build the production environment without hashing in the files, run `npm run prod:hashless`. This will give packages without a hash.  
To build the production environment with reduced file size, run `npm run prod:opt` (Takes extra time to build with build optimizer).
